            <p>
                I am a student / software engineer with interests in software development, graphic design, user experience, photography, and math/science.
                In my free time I program, play video games, rock climb, program, watch movies, and program.
                <br/><br/>
                I built this website myself. The frontend is based around AngularJS and Bootstrap. The server is based around NodeJS and ExpressJS. I use MongoDB for my database.
                I created my own API, which is used mainly for interfacing with the site's database. The API has the capability to manage database entities, manipulate images, and serve content.
                I created my own Content Management System, which utilizes my API to manage site content. It has useful tools for creating & managing photo galleries, project description pages, blog posts, users, featured items, and more.
                <br/><br/>
                Apart from my website, I am involved in Open Source and private projects. You can read a bit about them in the project section of my website.
